// I find that the people in my life
// come and go. They come due to either of
// our faults, but not one bitter thing has
// persisted through our fragmentation.
// I only remember the lessons that I've learned
// from them, and reflect positively on the
// lessons that they've integrated within me.

// I attribute my success, drive, and perspective
// towards those who have interacted with me,
// from minimal interactions to long-lived
// relationships.
