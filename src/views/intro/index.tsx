// This poem found on Heli Slimane's website circa 2005
// was an engineering marvel to me. An enigma among the
// countless PHP websites. They took it upon themself to
// design, animate, and code the poem into their artistic
// expression. The lengths that someone will take to
// express their relation and compassion to others amazes,
// inspires, and drives me.
